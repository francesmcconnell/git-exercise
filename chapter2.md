# Kelly & Squeaky's Battle


The campaign trail was filled with many more surreal moments, such as a televised cooking competition where Justina and Squeaky faced off in a battle to create the best acorn-inspired dish. Squeaky's acorn souffl√© garnered rave reviews from the judges, while Justina's acorn-crusted salmon fell flat with the audience.

 Justina was giving a passionate speech about the importance of education and affordable healthcare when suddenly, Squeaky interrupted her by jumping onto the podium and declaring that he would make acorns a form of currency if elected.

As election day drew near, the polls showed a neck-and-neck race between Justina and Squeaky, with many pundits predicting a historic upset in the making. The tension was palpable as the nation awaited the final results, eager to see whether a human or a squirrel would be leading the country for the next four years.
