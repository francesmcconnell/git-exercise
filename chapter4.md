# Squirrel Took an L


In the end, it was Kelly who emerged victorious, narrowly edging out Squeaky in a hotly contested race that will surely go down in history as one of the most unusual presidential campaigns of all time. As she took the oath of office, surrounded by her family and supporters, Kelly couldn't help but marvel at the strange and unpredictable journey that had led her to the highest office in the land.

And so, as the first human president to ever run against a squirrel, Kelly vowed to lead with wisdom, compassion, and a healthy dose of humor, knowing that she had overcome the odds and proven that anything was possible in the wild and wacky world of politics.
