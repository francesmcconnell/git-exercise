# Chapter 2


As the campaign kicked into high gear, Kelly and Squeaky found themselves facing off in a series of debates that ranged from the economy to foreign policy. It was a surreal sight to see a human and a squirrel debating the finer points of healthcare reform and tax policy, but somehow, they managed to keep a straight face and carry on with the serious business of running for president.

One of the most memorable moments of the campaign came during a town hall event in a small rural town in Iowa. Kelly was giving a passionate speech about the importance of education and affordable healthcare when suddenly, Squeaky interrupted her by jumping onto the podium and declaring that he would make acorns a form of currency if elected.

The crowd erupted into laughter and applause, with some even throwing acorns onto the stage in support of the squirrel's bold proposal. Kelly was momentarily flustered, but quickly regained her composure and retorted that while acorns were a valuable resource, they were not a practical form of currency for a modern society.
