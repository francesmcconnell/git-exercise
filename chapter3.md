# Squeaky Being Annoying


As the campaign kicked into high gear, Justina and Squeaky found themselves facing off in a series of debates that ranged from the economy to foreign policy. It was a surreal sight to see a human and a squirrel debating the finer points of healthcare reform and tax policy, but somehow, they managed to keep a straight face and carry on with the serious business of running for president.

One of the most memorable moments of the campaign came during a town hall event in a small rural town in Iowa. Justina was giving a passionate speech about the importance of education and affordable healthcare when suddenly, Squeaky interrupted her by jumping onto the podium and declaring that he would make acorns a form of currency if elected.

As election day drew near, the polls showed a neck-and-neck race between Justina and Squeaky, with many pundits predicting a historic upset in the making.
